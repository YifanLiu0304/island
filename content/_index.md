        Hello World! I am a PhD candidate at Georgia Tech, majoring in Public Policy and Computer Science. As a computational social scientist, I use AI/ML and computational methods to study energy, transportation, and technology policies. 

        I apply a range of quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate the social challenges and inform evidence-based decision-making in energy, transportation, and technology policy.
