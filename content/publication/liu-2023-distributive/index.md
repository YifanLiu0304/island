abstract: "The rapid expansion of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is critical for supporting the transition to sustainable transportation. However, concerns about distributive equity in charging infrastructure deployment have emerged, particularly regarding whether disadvantaged communities have adequate access to charging facilities. This study examines the distribution of EV charging infrastructure across different demographic and socioeconomic groups in the United States, using data from the Climate & Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST). We analyze the relationship between charging station density and various indicators of community disadvantage, including income levels, racial composition, and environmental justice factors. Our findings reveal significant disparities in charging infrastructure access, with lower-income and minority communities often having fewer charging stations per capita. We also identify patterns of charging infrastructure deployment that may exacerbate existing transportation inequities. The results highlight the importance of incorporating equity considerations into EV infrastructure planning and policy development. We discuss potential policy interventions to address these disparities and ensure more equitable access to charging infrastructure across different communities."
