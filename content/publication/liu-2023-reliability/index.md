abstract: "This paper presents a novel cross-lingual deep learning approach to analyze the reliability of electric vehicle charging infrastructure. We develop and validate a methodology that processes user-generated content across multiple languages to identify and categorize charging station reliability issues. Our findings contribute to the understanding of EV charging infrastructure challenges and provide insights for improving service reliability."
