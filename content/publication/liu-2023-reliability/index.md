abstract: 'Vehicle electrification has emerged as a global strategy to address climate change and emissions externalities from the transportation sector. Deployment of charging infrastructure is needed to accelerate technology adoption; however, managers and policymakers have had limited evidence on the use of public charging stations due to poor data sharing and decentralized ownership across regions. In this article, we use machine learning based classifiers to reveal insights about consumer charging behavior in 72 detected languages including Chinese. We investigate 10 years of consumer reviews in East and Southeast Asia from 2011 to 2021 to enable infrastructure evaluation at a larger geographic scale than previously available. We find evidence that charging stations at government locations result in higher failure rates with consumers compared to charging stations at private points of interest. This evidence contrasts with predictions in the U.S. and European markets, where the performance is closer to parity. We also find that networked stations with communication protocols provide a relatively higher quality of charging services, which favors policy support for connectivity, particularly for underserved or remote areas.'
