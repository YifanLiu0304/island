abstract: 'The rapid deployment of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure has created a need for systematic evaluation of charging station performance. While machine learning (ML) models have shown promise in predicting charging station reliability, their black-box nature limits interpretability for policymakers. This paper compares the effectiveness of different explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods in evaluating EV charging infrastructure. We implement and compare multiple interpretability techniques including SHAP, LIME, and counterfactual explanations. Our analysis reveals that charging station location characteristics and temporal usage patterns are the most influential features in predicting station reliability. We find that SHAP values provide more consistent and policy-relevant explanations compared to other methods. The results demonstrate how XAI can enhance the transparency and utility of ML models in infrastructure policy evaluation.'
