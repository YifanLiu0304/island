abstract: 'Community-wide adoption of sustainable travel modes such as transit, walking, and biking can alleviate congestion and emissions while improving air quality and public health. However, promoting these modes in the U.S. is challenging due to the high reliance on personal vehicles, which contribute $260 billion annually in social costs. Information about health and environmental externalities of personal vehicle usage is often unavailable to travelers at the time of decision-making. This study explores whether mobile app-based information provision about the health and environmental benefits of sustainable modes can meaningfully change traveler preferences. In a sample of 3,470 U.S. car users aged 55 years and under, balanced by gender, income, and census regions, this study tested the effectiveness of information provision over a 90-day summer season, targeting bus transit, walking, and biking. Results show that participants who received information on environmental benefits related to emission reductions were four times more likely to choose bus transit, while those informed about active health benefits related to calories burned were nearly seven times more likely to choose walking, compared to the control group. However, due to barriers such as safety concerns and lack of infrastructure, health and environmental information was not effective at promoting biking. The results may be scalable to a large segment of travelers in the U.S., but the study did not test the effectiveness of these interventions for travelers 55 and over due to sampling limitations. Low-cost mobile app-based implementation strategies for possible deployment of these interventions in U.S. communities are discussed.'
