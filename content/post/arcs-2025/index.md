I will be presenting my research on the effects of competition on supplementary service quality in the context of sustainable transportation infrastructure at the upcoming Alliance for Research on Corporate Sustainability (ARCS) Conference. The conference will be held at HEC Paris from June 1-4, 2025.

This presentation will focus on the effects of competition on supplementary service quality and their implications for sustainable transportation infrastructure. Many companies are providing sustainability-oriented supplementary services such as carbon credits to offset airline emissions and electric vehicle (EV) recharging at hotels. Despite their being a growing source of revenue and differentiation, little is known about what drives the wide variation in the quality of supplementary services. We examine how competition influences the reliability of U.S. public EV charging stations, an increasingly popular supplementary service offered by hotels, retailers, parking facilities, and other businesses. Analyzing 27,192 charging stations from 2011 to 2024, we apply machine learning methods to measure their reliability. We find that increased competition among establishments providing the same core business increases charging reliability, but that charging station reliability declines as more charging competition arises from establishments offering different core businesses. The latter is especially important given most EV charging stations in the U.S. compete against establishments operating different core businesses. We project that an average annual increase in competition is associated with a decrease in service reliability scores ranging from 11% to 23% across the most common establishment types over a 5-year period. We also find that the effects of competition attenuate within 10 miles and are not statistically different from zero in rural or disadvantaged areas.
