I'm excited to announce that I will be presenting my research on electric vehicle charging infrastructure reliability at the upcoming Alliance for Research on Corporate Sustainability (ARCS) Conference. The conference will be held at HEC Paris from June 1-4, 2025.

This presentation will focus on our findings regarding the reliability patterns of EV charging stations and their implications for sustainable transportation infrastructure. I look forward to engaging with fellow researchers and practitioners in the field of corporate sustainability.
